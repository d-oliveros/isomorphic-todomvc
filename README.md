# Isomorphic TodoMVC

Isomorphic TodoMVC example with React, Isomorphine, Webpack, Baobab, Mongo.

## Global Dependencies
* Node.js
* MongoDB

By default, the app will try to connect to the mongo process running in localhost, port 6379. To use a different database connection, copy `.env.default` to `.env` and modify `.env` accordingly.

## Installation
```
npm install
```

You also need Mongo running in the system.

## Starts the server
```
gulp dev
```

Cheers.
